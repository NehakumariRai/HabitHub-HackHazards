🚀 HabitHub 
 Build Habits, One Streak at a Time


📌 Problem Statement
Problem Statement 9 – Build the Ultimate Digital Habit Builder
Create a tool that helps people build and stick to habits in a fun, rewarding, and social way - going beyond streaks to include accountability, reflection, and nudges.


🎯 Objective
HabitHub is a Chrome Extension focused on helping users develop strong, consistent habits through a lightweight and gamified experience. The extension offers streak-based progression, habit unlocking mechanisms, and actionable reminders—all embedded seamlessly in the browser.

It’s designed for:

Students seeking daily discipline

Professionals building routines

Anyone who wants to build sustainable, distraction-free habits without relying on bloated apps or cloud logins

🧠 Team & Development Approach
Solo Developer: Nehakumari Rai
GitHub: [Nehakumari Rai](https://github.com/NehakumariRai)
Role: Web Developer


Why I Chose This Problem
As someone passionate about self-improvement, I’ve often found existing habit trackers too complex or overly dependent on cloud accounts. I wanted a minimal, fast, and focused solution that could live right in the browser—a space where we spend most of our time.

Key Development Highlights
Replaced Firebase with localStorage to ensure offline-first experience

Created custom logic to unlock new habit slots only after a 7-day streak

Built Chrome Alarms and Notification-based reminder system with persistent alerts

Designed a sleek, responsive popup UI with Home and Leisure sections

Crafted motivational “snooze” messages to gently encourage task completion


🛠️ Tech Stack
Core Technologies Used:

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (Vanilla), JavaScript (ES6+)

Browser APIs: Chrome Extensions API (Alarms, Notifications, Storage)

Data Storage: localStorage for habit data and streak history

No Backend Required: All logic runs locally in the extension

Hosting: Chrome Web Store (submission in progress)


Sponsor Tech (Not Used):
Although powerful sponsor technologies were available, the extension was kept simple and offline for speed, reliability, and ease of access.


✨ Key Features

🏁 Final Words
As a solo developer, this hackathon journey was incredibly enriching. It pushed me to learn Chrome APIs, design minimalist interfaces, and think critically about behavioral design.

What started as a small idea turned into a tool I personally use—and I hope others find value in too. The experience taught me resilience, decision-making, and the joy of seeing something work after hours of debugging. 🚀

HabitHub is one small system that helps you rise.
